                <p>
                    I was the first employee of CrowdControlHQ, going from Lead Developer to reporting directly to the board as Head of Technology from 2009 - 2014. The technology team grew from a team of 2 to 8, overseeing an architecture growth went from 1 to 50+ servers.<br/>
                    It is now the UKs leading social risk and compliance platform, used by large public sector organisations, from police forces to utility providers and social media agencies. CrowdControlHQ was a finalist for Software Innovation of the Year in the Digital Entrepreneur Awards 2014, and goes on to do great things in the social media world.

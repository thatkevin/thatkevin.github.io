                    I was a web developer and technical adviser for a number of projects at Practical Action, an international development charity based in Warwickshire. <br>
                    The main project was a large information respository called Practical Answers - take a look, you can learn how to make your own compost toilet! I also developed an iPlayer style video website to view their instructional videos on demand, and consulted in rolling out their online donation site.

## Aliases

I use .oh-my-zsh as a shell, and have a series of aliases and scripts set up for quick development / laziness. [I've put them on github](https://github.com/thatkevin/kool-scripts).

Here's the aliases[^1]:

```md
{% include aliases.md %}
```

I especially find the docker scripts helpful - `dce` jumping into the first container is super handy, and `dcu` automatically starting the docker-desktop daemon automatically is 👨‍🍳😘.

[^1]: I got this jekyll page to update with the [README](https://github.com/thatkevin/kool-scripts/blob/master/README.md) automatically by doing a hardlink: `ln ../../Scripts/README.md _includes/aliases.md`

## Set up

This is a series of instructions for setting up a macbook, M1 chip, for day-to-day development, including Ruby, Docker, zsh, Postgres, MySql, GraphQL, AWS etc. Run any of this at your own risk. 


```bash
# This assumes set up as done on a default mac

# login to icloud, and allow icloud. enjoy the myriad of 2FA methods across your ios devices
# enable touch ID, add yr prints

# a few commands for dev defaults
chflags nohidden ~/Library
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar -bool true
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowStatusBar -bool true
